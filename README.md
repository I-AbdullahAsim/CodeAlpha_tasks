# CodeAlpha_tasks
It starts by loading a dataset of music listening history, with details like the user, the track, artist, album, and time. Then, the data is prepared for analysis by tidying up the data i.e. combining date and time information, sorting the data for easier tracking of listening patterns, and creating a new column to flag repeated plays within a 30-day window.

Next, it transforms the user, track, artist, and album names into numerical representations, making them easier for machine learning algorithms to handle. Since there is an imbalance between repeated and non-repeated plays, a technique called SMOTE is used to balance things out. The data is then split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the prediction models.

The code then employs a few different machine learning models. First, a Random Forest model is trained with some predefined settings. Then, a Gradient Boosting model is trained, which often performs well in various prediction tasks. To potentially get even better results, these two models are combined using a technique called Stacking, the final model Logistic Regression learns how to best combine the predictions from the individual models.

Finally, the code evaluates the performance of each model and the combined stacked model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. It also includes a confusion matrix to see where the models are making mistakes, and it looks at some specific examples where the predictions were wrong. This helps understand the strengths and weaknesses of the models and can guide further improvements.
